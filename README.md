# CPE2600 - Systems Programming
## Overview

This repository contains my work from the **CPE2600 - Systems Programming** class at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (Fall 2024). 
The course focuses on programming at the systems level using the C programming language, exploring how programs interact with the operating system, managing processes, memory, and concurrency.

## Learning Objectives

This was provided by the course syllabus:

- Navigate through a Unix system environment.
- Create and manage users, groups, files, and permissions.
- Navigate and manage the Unix file system and directory structure.
- Construct and execute shell scripts.
- Write procedural programs in C.
- Understand the use of variables, types, expressions, functions, parameters, and arguments.
- Explain how variables are allocated in memory, the relationship between variables and pointers, and the scope and lifetime of variables.
- Use build and debug tools for software development (e.g., make, gdb, valgrind).
- Use a version control system to manage software development.
- Construct programs that use static and dynamic memory allocation along with proper use of pointers and pointer arithmetic.
- Explain how programs interact with an operating system through system calls.
- Construct programs to create processes that communicate using inter processes communication mechanisms.
- Construct programs that interact with the file system.
- Construct programs with multiple threads that use concurrency mechanisms to control access to shared resources.
